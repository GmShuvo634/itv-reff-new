# Position Level System

## Overview
The system consists of 12 levels: Intern and L1 to L11. Each level requires a job security deposit (except Intern) and offers a fixed number of tasks per day with a unit price per task. The income is calculated as:
- Daily Income = Number of Tasks × Unit Price
- Monthly Income = Daily Income × 30
- Annual Income = Daily Income × 365

Note: The validity period for L1-L11 is one year (365 days). Internship lasts 4 days.

# Referral (Invitation) Rewards

## Overview
When you invite someone to join, you receive a one-time reward based on your current position level and the level of the person you invited (but note the rule: if you invite someone at a higher level, you only get 10% of your own level's reward). The rewards are structured in three tiers (A, B, C):
- **A-level**: Direct invite (you get 10% of a base reward that depends on your level)
- **B-level**: Invite by your A-level (you get 3% of the base reward)
- **C-level**: Invite by your B-level (you get 1% of the base reward)

The base reward for each level is given in the table. The reward percentages (10%, 3%, 1%) are fixed across levels.

## Referral Reward Table

| Job Level | Income Ratio | A-level (10%) | B-level (3%) | C-level (1%) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| L1        | 10%-3%-1%    | 200           | 60           | 20           |
| L2        | 10%-3%-1%    | 500           | 150          | 50           |
| L3        | 10%-3%-1%    | 2,000         | 600          | 200          |
| L4        | 10%-3%-1%    | 5,000         | 1,500        | 500          |
| L5        | 10%-3%-1%    | 10,000        | 3,000        | 1,000        |
| L6        | 10%-3%-1%    | 25,000        | 7,500        | 2,500        |
| L7        | 10%-3%-1%    | 50,000        | 15,000       | 5,000        |
| L8        | 10%-3%-1%    | 100,000       | 30,000       | 10,000       |
| L9        | 10%-3%-1%    | 200,000       | 60,000       | 20,000       |
| L10       | 10%-3%-1%    | 400,000       | 120,000      | 40,000       |
| L11       | 10%-3%-1%    | 800,000       | 240,000      | 80,000       |

### Rules and Examples:
1. **Rule 1**: If you invite someone at the same or lower level, you get the full reward for your level as per the table.
2. **Rule 2**: If you invite someone at a higher level, you only get 10% of the reward for your own current level (the A-level reward for your level).
   - Example: If you are at L1 and you invite someone who becomes L2 (higher than you), you get only 200 PKR (which is the A-level reward for L1).
3. **Example 1**: As a L1 member, if you invite a subordinate A who becomes L1, you get 200 PKR (A-level). If that A-level subordinate then invites a B-level (who becomes L1), you get 60 PKR (B-level). If that B-level invites a C-level (who becomes L1), you get 20 PKR (C-level).
4. **Example 2**: As a L4 member, if you invite a subordinate A who becomes L4, you get 5,000 PKR (A-level).

# Task Management Bonus

## Overview
After your subordinates complete their daily tasks, you earn a bonus based on their level in your downline and their task income. The bonus ratios are:
- **A-level subordinates**: 8% of their daily task income
- **B-level subordinates**: 3% of their daily task income
- **C-level subordinates**: 1% of their daily task income

This bonus is recurring and earned every day that the subordinate completes tasks.

## Bonus Structure

| Subordinate Level | Bonus Ratio | Example: Per Task of 1,000 PKR |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| A-level           | 8%          | 80 PKR                         |
| B-level           | 3%          | 30 PKR                         |
| C-level           | 1%          | 10 PKR                         |

## Example Calculation
Assume:
- You have: 10 A-level, 100 B-level, 1,000 C-level subordinates.
- Each subordinate has an average daily task income of 1,000 PKR.

Then:
- A-level bonus: `10 * 1,000 * 8% = 800 PKR`
- B-level bonus: `100 * 1,000 * 3% = 3,000 PKR`
- C-level bonus: `1,000 * 1,000 * 1% = 10,000 PKR`
- **Total daily bonus**: `800 + 3,000 + 10,000 = 13,800 PKR`

Note: The example uses 1,000 PKR as the average daily income per subordinate, but in reality, the income of each subordinate depends on their own position level.

# Summary of Income Streams

A member can earn through:
1. **Direct Task Income**: By completing their own daily tasks.
2. **Referral Rewards**: One-time rewards for inviting new members (A, B, C levels).
3. **Task Management Bonus**: Recurring bonuses from the task income of their downline (A, B, C levels).

This system encourages members to:
- Upgrade their own position (to earn more per task and to unlock higher referral rewards).
- Build a wide and deep team to maximize recurring bonuses.
