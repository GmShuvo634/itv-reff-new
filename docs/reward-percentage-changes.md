### Business Impact
1. **Increased Referral Incentive**: Higher rewards for A-Level referrers will encourage more active participation in the referral program
2. **Competitive Advantage**: The increased rewards make the platform more attractive compared to competitors
3. **User Retention**: Higher rewards can improve user satisfaction and retention

## Verification
All changes have been verified through testing scripts that confirm:
- Reward rates are correctly calculated at 10%-3%-1%
- All position levels have appropriate reward values
- No calculation errors in the new structure

## Example Calculations
For a user at L5 (100,000 PKR deposit):
- **A-Level Referrer**: 10% of 100,000 = 10,000 PKR
- **B-Level Referrer**: 3% of 100,000 = 3,000 PKR
- **C-Level Referrer**: 1% of 100,000 = 1,000 PKR

This is an increase of 2,000 PKR for A-Level referrers compared to the previous 8% structure.
